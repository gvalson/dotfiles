# Gvalson's dotfiles

This repository serves as a public channel for my personal configuration files. You
are free to look at, download, inspect, and modify these files for your personal use.

Don't forget to enable showing hidden files if you're on a UNIX system, as some are
hidden for the sake of consistency.

The `dot-config` folder refers to `.config`, commonly found at the home directory
(`~`).
